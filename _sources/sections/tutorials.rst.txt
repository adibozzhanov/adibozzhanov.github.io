Tutorials
=========

.. note::

   I often build some small projects that simply cannot be put as a separate "project".
   A lot of these end up being some really good tutoring material that I use for private
   tutoring. Here you will see a collection of small projects explained in a meaningful
   and accessible way which will hopefully help you understand programming basics better.




As you can see I have separated them by language. The 4 languages: Python, Haskell, C and Java
are required by my position as a programming tutor at UCL. It is important to mention that, these
tutorials are heavilly biased towards Python and C since I just simply enjoy those languages more.
